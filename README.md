# Fullstack Open Course Submissions

This repository contains my submissions for the Fullstack Open course. Fullstack Open is a comprehensive online course focused on modern web development, covering both frontend and backend technologies. It provides hands-on exercises and projects to help developers learn and improve their skills.

## Course Overview

The Fullstack Open course covers a wide range of topics and technologies, including:

- JavaScript and ECMAScript 6
- React.js and Redux
- Node.js and Express
- RESTful APIs
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- GraphQL and Apollo
- Testing and test-driven development (TDD)
- TypeScript
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
- Docker and containerization
- Authentication and authorization
- Security and best practices
- Deployment to the cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS)

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different parts, corresponding to the various sections of the Fullstack Open course. Each part consists of multiple exercises and projects aimed at practicing and demonstrating the concepts taught in the course.

The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
├── part0
├── part1
├── part2
├── part3
├── part4
├── part5
├── part6
└── part7
```

Each `partX` directory contains subdirectories for individual exercises or projects. The naming convention for the subdirectories is usually `exercises` or `project`, followed by a number or a descriptive name.

## Running the Code

To run the exercises or projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/FullStackOpenSubmissions.git`.
